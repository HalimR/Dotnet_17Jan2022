Inheritance
It is the mechanism in C# by which one class is 
allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.

Single inheritance
A <-> B

Multilevel inheritance
A <-> B <-> C

Hierarchical inheritance
A <-> B
A <-> C

Polymorphism
Polymorphism provides the ability to a class to have multiple implementations with the same name.
-Dynamic - virtual/overrid -> can only occur when use inheritance
