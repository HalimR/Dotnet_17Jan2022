Scope of Day 3
1-Stored Procedures
2-Triggers
3-Cursors
4-Functions
5-Transactions

sequence -> order in which instructions occur and proccessed

selection -> determine which path to take (i.e. if,else) 

iteration -> repeat execution of a section of a code (i.e. while)

Stored Procedure ~ SQL Programmers
-A stored procedure is a set of Structured Query Language (SQL) statements with an assigned name, 
which are stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS) as a group, 
so it can be reused and shared by multiple programs.

SP Advantages
1- one time execution, much smoother
2- dont have to do sql injection, much safer, send as param -> object
3- encapsulation -> dont need to know the database/table
4- simplicity, queries might be too long

Transaction -> ACID properties
Tran -> Rollback/Commit
very safe, avoid mistakes, once commited there is no turning back

Atomicity - All done or not at all
Cosistency - Consistent before and after transaction
Isolation - Multiple transaction occure independatently without interference
Durability - changes of a successful transaction occur even if system failure occur

Scalar function - return 1 value
Tabular function - return a table, cannot do DML queries for this, only return purposes(own table)

Cursors
1-Declare
2-Open
3-Fetch
4-While -> Fetch
5-Close
6-Deallocate

*most of these can be placed in stored procedure
