1.Data Source
2.user id = sa
3.password
4.Initial Catalog -> dbSample28Jan22

cmd -> DML
insert into tblUser values(@un,@pass,@name,@age)
result -> int

Example scenario~
Connectionstring
Data Source=<desktop>;user id=sa;password=<password>;Initial Catalog=dbSample28Jan2022;

//If using Windows Authentication
Data Source=<desktop>;Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=dbSample28Jan2022;

Other Architecture
3 tier architecture
i.e. microservice base architecture
-if 1db went down, not every db will go down as well

n tier architecture
